# GeometricMoldingByContraction
We present an algorithm to convert a plane sheet to any surface by only contracting (and not expanding) some parts of it. We call this method as Metric Molding. We use the first fundamental form of a surface to generate these patterns. The method has been explained in the paper: [To Be Published]
