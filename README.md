# GeometricMoldingByContraction
We present algorithms to convert a plane sheet to any surface by only contracting (and not expanding) some parts of it. We call these methods as Tailoring, Metric Molding, Triangular Molding etc. We use the first fundamental form of a surface to generate these patterns. The method has been explained in the paper: [To Be Published]
